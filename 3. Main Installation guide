Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend :
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 introduces a significant architectural change as it is a full Linux kernel built by Microsoft, allowing Linux containers to run natively 
without emulation. With Docker Desktop running on WSL 2, users can leverage Linux workspaces and avoid having to maintain both Linux and Windows build scripts. In addition, WSL2
provides improvements to file system sharing, boot time, and allows access to some cool new features for Docker Desktop users.

Docker Desktop uses the dynamic memory allocation feature in WSL 2 to greatly improve the resource consumption. This means, Docker Desktop only uses the required amount of CPU 
and memory resources it needs, while enabling CPU and memory-intensive tasks such as building a container to run much faster.
Additionally, with WSL 2, the time required to start a Docker daemon after a cold start is significantly faster. It takes less than 10 seconds to start the Docker daemon when 
compared to almost a minute in the previous version of Docker Desktop.

1>> Prerequisites : Before you install the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend, you must complete the following steps:
                (1). Install Windows 10, version 1903 or higher.
                (2). Enable WSL 2 feature on Windows. For detailed instructions, refer to the Microsoft documentation( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 )
                (3). Download and install the Linux kernel update package.

***NOTES: Troubleshooting installation: (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#troubleshooting-installation)
Error: WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component. In other words, If the Linux kernel package is missing in the %SystemRoot%\system32\lxss\tools folder, you will 
       encounter this error. Resolve it by installing the Linux kernel update MSI package in step #4 of these installation instructions. You may need to uninstall the MSI from 
       'Add or Remove Programs', and install it again.
Resolve: (1). Download the Linux kernel update package, please visit "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package".
         (2). Run the update package downloaded in the previous step.
         (3). After installation the next step is setting WSL 2 as your default version when installing new Linux distributions:
              wsl --set-default-version 2 -> To Set WSL 2 as your default version
2>> Select the "Use WSL 2 based engine" box (If you have installed Docker Desktop on a system that supports WSL 2, this option will be enabled BY DEFAULT). Click Apply & Restart.
3>> Ensure the distribution runs in WSL 2 mode.
    "wsl.exe -l -v" or "wsl -l -v" -> To check the WSL mode
4>> When Docker Desktop restarts, go to "Settings > Resources > WSL Integration". The Docker-WSL integration will be enabled on your default WSL distribution.
    **NOTES : wsl --set-default <distro name> -> To change your default WSL distro e.g., wsl --set-default ubuntu -> to set Ubuntu as your default WSL distro
5>> Click Apply & Restart.
